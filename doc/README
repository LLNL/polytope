The included tarball contains the LaTeX source for an article outlining the
capabilities of Polytope. This is not meant as a guide for using Polytope but 
rather a description of the algorithms implemented and motivations for the
code's underlying design decisions.

To unpack the tarball run
tar -xzf PolytopeOverview.tar.gz

We recommend using "pdflatex -shell-escape" to compile the .tex source
