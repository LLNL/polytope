Building polytope requires CMake 2.8, found at http://www.cmake.org/, as
well as GNU make. To build polytope on a UNIX-like system, use the following
commands:

     $ make config
     $ make

Other make commands
-------------------
   $ make test 
          Runs all tests provided with the polytope library.
   
   $ make clean 
          Removes all object files but retains the configuration options.
   
   $ make distclean 
          Performs clean and completely removes the build directory.
