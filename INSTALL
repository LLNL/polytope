Building polytope requires CMake 2.8, found at http://www.cmake.org/, as
well as GNU make. To build polytope on a UNIX-like system, use the following
commands:

     $ make config
     $ make

Other make commands
-------------------
   $ make test 
          Runs all tests provided with the polytope library.
   
   $ make clean 
          Removes all object files but retains the configuration options.
   
   $ make distclean 
          Performs clean and completely removes the build directory.

Polytope provides interfaces for a number of tools:

- Voro++ by Chris Rycroft at LBL
- Triangle by Jonathan Shewchuck at Berkeley
- Tetgen by Hang Si

Support for Triangle and Tetgen is available with minimal effort, but you 
must respect the licenses of their authors and make arrangements with them 
if you want to use them in a commercial application. As a result, we do not 
distribute the source for either of these tools. If you want to build in 
support for Triangle and/or Tetgen, you will need to do the following: 

- For triangle, copy triangle.h and triangle.c to src/.
- For tetgen, copy tetgen.h and tetgen.cxx to src/.
