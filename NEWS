Release 0.5.1

Minor bugfix release:

- Puts the ASSERT2 macro inside the polytope namespace to avoid conflicts with
  host codes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.5.0

Initial release of polytope.  Includes functional 2D tessellator
TriangleTessellator and somewhat flaky VoroPP_2d and VoroPP_3d tessellators.
The DistributedTessellator seems to be working OK as well.  TetgenTessellator is
not passing it's unit tests.

Basically this release is intended as an initial beta release for the 2D
Triangle based tessellator, both serial and parallel.
